Assignment: Implement a Custom Iterator in Rust
Problem Statement
You are required to implement a simple counter using Rust that behaves 
like an iterator. Your task is to define a Counter struct and implement 
the Iterator trait for it so that it returns the numbers from 1 to 5, 
one by one.
Requirements
Create a struct named Counter with a single field count of type u32.
Implement a method new() that initializes Counter with count = 0.
Implement the Iterator trait for Counter:


Set the associated Item type to u32.
Implement the next() method to:
Increment count each time it is called.
Return Some(count) while count <= 5.
Return None once the counter exceeds 5.
In the main function, use the iterator to print numbers 1 through 5 to 
the console.
